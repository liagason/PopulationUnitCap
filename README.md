# Strategic Restraint - Mod for Unciv
This mod reduces the ability to maintain large armies for both the player and AI, making unit management a more critical part of the game. Players and AI alike will face higher unit maintenance costs and limited supply, requiring careful planning when it comes to military forces. While the AI retains its advantages in growth and production, they too will struggle to support large armies.
